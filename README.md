### Hey! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Elijah. I am a young programmer that works in Python, JavaScript, and Swift. I am best at Python, and I make Discord bots with it. Check out this [website](https://www.elijahsutilities.net)!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Discord bot.
-   You can invite it [here](https://top.gg/https://top.gg/bot/1036384426113908756)!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently fluent in Python, partially fluent in JavaScript, Swift, and C#. I am bad at Java, and learning Rust.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on simple Python projects. (Simple not meaning basic, just not complex :)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any issues with my repositories.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Discord bot!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 
  - Discord: elijahsears7#5573
  - Github Issues (On Repository)
  - Github Discussions (On Repository)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I made a game when I was 10 years old in Unity. It just launches a box forever into space.
## Frameworks
Here are the frameworks that I am good in.
- Speed: Approx. how fast I am able to write the code.
- Experience: How much I know about the framework, and how fast I can make use of it. This doesn't mean I am a professional at the framework, it just means I am good enough to program fast and fluently.
- Knowledge is the amount of completion of the framework. If the knowledge is low, there will be a **LOT** of Googling. I will ***NOT*** be counting full completion for commands that are rarely used/needed.Language is how much experience I have in the *language*, not the *framework*. I type at 50 WPM for benchmark.
### Python
- Language: I am pretty fast at Python.

For Discord.py, you can check out my experience in this [repository](https://github.com/thecommoncoder765/elijahs-utilities-ultimate). The main bot file is in ./bot/main.py.
 Framework   | Experience (1-10) | Speed (LnPerMin) | Knowledge (%) |
 ----------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
 Discord.py  | 8-10              | 38               | 30%           |
